The additional information section can contain useful information, and you are expected to cache any result found there. However, in the actual processing of the current lookup, the only time you have to use it is when the answer section has no results and you need the address for a name server provided in the authority section. In that case you need to look for the name of that name server in the Additional information section. If you cannot find the name then you need to start a new query to get the IP address of the name server before continuing with the original lookup.

One thing to remember is that when communicating with a name server you will always be using an IPV4 address even if you are doing a lookup for an IPV6 address. This means that if you ever need to get an IP address for a nameserver you will need to do IPV4 lookup for the nameserver address even if you are looking for an IPV6 address. It also means that once you have the IPV4 address of the nameserver you will need to make sure that the queries to that server are for an IPV6 name if you are doing and IPV6 lookup.
